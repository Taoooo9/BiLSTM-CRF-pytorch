told O

He O
said O
further O

that O

it O

by O
the O
European B-ORG

He O
said O
a O
proposal O
last O

by O

to O
ban O
sheep O
brains O
, O

was O
a O
highly O
specific O
and O
precautionary O
move O
to O
protect O

. O

Fischler S-PER
proposed O
EU-wide S-MISC

after O

standing O
veterinary O

questioned O
if O
